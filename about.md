<p><em>First - what's with the tagline: <a href="http://kevan.emmott.com/2004/12/22/looking-for-cannonballs">cannonballs</a> and <a href="http://kevan.emmott.com/2004/10/08/more-gems-from-quicksilver">acorns</a>?</em></p>
<p>They're quotes from Neal Stephenson's series, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060833165?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kevanemmottco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060833165">The Baroque Cycle</a>, which is great (if a bit on the blow-your-mind-how-frickin-ginormous-it-is side).</p>
<p><em>OK... so who the heck is Kevan Emmott?<br />
